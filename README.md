# Rock Creek Outdoors - Target System

## Four Rules Of Gun Safety
1. All guns are always loaded
2. Never point a gun at something you are unwilling to destroy
3. Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on the target
4. Be sure of your target (and what's behind it)

### Description
This repo contains several target programs that can be run on the Arduino Uno platform. They are designed as a prototype of different target systems that could then be mass produced in an application specific board.

### Tools
We used several tools to create these programs.

* Arduino IDE - http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
* Fritzing, circuit diagramming tool (uses *.fz files) - http://fritzing.org
* Falstad Circuit Simulator, helpful java applet - http://www.falstad.com/circuit/

## Follow The Dot Target
### 3 targets
This program is designed for the shooter to start in a holstered position and then draw and fire at whichever target is currently lit (do not reholster until completely finished with the drill). Basically, shoot the dot.
